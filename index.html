        <strong>Chanel’s</strong> new handbag campaign, entitled “The Chanel Iconic”, shines the</br>
        spotlight on one of the French house’s forever classics: the 11.12. Commonly</br>
        referred to as the Chanel Flap bag, the quilted shoulder style takes the</br>
        blueprint of the 2.55 bag and gives it a twist – literally. While the 2.55</br>
        features a rectangular lock, the 11.12 fastens shut with a double-C turn-style</br>
        clasp. The 2.55’s chain-link strap is replaced with a metal chain interwoven</br>
        with leather on a functional-yet-decorative day-to-day accessory, or an</br>
        “accomplice”, as it’s affectionately described by the brand.

        <strong>Chanel is Staging A Feminist Coup At The National Portrait Gallery</strong>

            <strong>Chanel</strong> acolytes will naturally be able to recite the history of the 2.55 – from</br>
            the specific purpose of the seven discreet pockets to the quilting inspired by</br>
            the padded jackets beloved in the equestrian world. Born in February 1955</br>
            (hence its 2.55 moniker), it was not until the ’80s that the 11.12 iteration rose</br>
            in popularity under the creative helm of Karl Lagerfeld. “Eternally elegant,</br>
            the 11.12 felt cunningly familiar due to being influenced by the iconic 2.55</br>
            bag,” says the brand of its ability to revamp its signatures, while retaining the</br>
            same sense of timelessness at Chanel’s core.

        <h4><em>“If you’re sad, add more lipstick and attack,” Coco Chanel once said.</br> Thus, one of the seven inner
          pockets of the 2.55 and the 11.12 is</br> still dedicated to mood-boosting cosmetics.</em></h4>

          The pandemic has spurred on fashion’s advancement towards a greener</br>
          future, in which the season a garment belongs to no longer defines it, and</br>
          thus, the Chanel Iconic campaign couldn’t feel more timely. As the label</br>
          neatly puts it in its description of the 11.12, the Flap bag is “a rare case of</br>
          practicality and ingenuity balanced by allure”: the perfect combination and</br>
          the ultimate investment purchase.
